# MNIST Digit Recognizer

A simple and clear implementation of handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.  
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

___

## üß† Overview

This project aims to classify handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) from the popular MNIST dataset. The implementation includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- A simple neural network model (can be extended to CNN)
- Training and evaluation routines
- Visualization of predictions and loss curves

___

## ‚ú® Features
- The entire neural network is implemented from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. 
- The network is built using a modular approach, with layers and activation functions defined as reusable Python classes.

___

## üõ†Ô∏èInstallation
This project requires only Python 3

___

## üöÄ Usage
```python train_convnet.py```

## Future Plans
- Build a diffusion model from scratch
